# DDPG-for-Continuous-mountain-car-problem-openAI-gym-using-Keras-and-Tensorflow

Deep deterministic policy gradient using Keras and Tensorflow with python to solve the Continous mountainc car problem provided
by OpenAI gym.

Input to the model is the state of the car (position and velocity) while the output is a single real-valued number indicating
the deterministic action to take given a state.

This work uses many tuorials that I found online and much pf my code is similar to the already existing tutorials available online
